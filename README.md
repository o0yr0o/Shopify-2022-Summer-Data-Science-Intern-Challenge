# Shopify - 2022 Summer Data Science Intern Challenge

## Question 1
Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.
1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
    - The reason why the AOV is so large is because some orders purchased large amount of sneakers per order which would increase the value per order, these extreme values could effect AOV.
    - We can calculate value per sneakers to check if the value per sneakers is reasonable, then calculate the average value per sneakers.
3. What metric would you report for this dataset?

5. What is its value?
    - Average value per sneakers is $152.48.
    - After I calculated the value per sneakers in each order, I found some orders have unreasonable high value of sneakers, so I deleted these outliers to increase the accuracy.
